# Eye Tracking Mouse Control

This project implements an eye-tracking system that allows users to control the mouse cursor using their eye movements. The application utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time eye detection and tracking, along with PyAutoGUI for simulating mouse movements and clicks.

## Features

- Control the mouse cursor with eye movements.
- Click functionality by detecting eye position.
- Real-time feedback with visual markers on the user's face.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repositoryname.git
   ```

2. **Change to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd repositoryname
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure your webcam is connected and functioning.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python eye_tracking_mouse_control.py
   ```
3. Look at the designated points on your face to control the cursor.

## Controls

- **Move Cursor**: Move your eyes to the right or left.


## Notes

- Ensure proper lighting for better detection accuracy.
- Adjust the camera position for optimal tracking.
